# color-game

This game test your knowledge on RGB colors. RGB is a color model which uses red, green, and blue to create an array of different colors. Check out the RGB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">Wikipedia page</a> for further information.

This game has three different difficulty levels(easy, medium, hard). Each level has a increasing number of colors starting at 3 and ending at 9. There is an option to rest the colors and play again.
